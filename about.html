        <h1>Hello Welcome</h1>
        <p>This website was made to give a brief preview of the Classic 1994 rap album ‘Illmatic’ by New York’s very own, Nas. When developing my initial sketches for this assignment I wanted to have elements that move and continue to move while you are on the screen browsing. I did my best with the time allowed to work on this assignment however, an extra week or two would have allowed me to create more detailed animations. </p>
        <p>Some issues I encountered while coding were the @keyframe animations and creating fluid transitions/ motions without javascript or Jquiery. This assignment was givne by Ian Pollack during his Web Authoring class at CSUEB spring qt 2018. I found this project to be more than challenging due to my lack in understanding the complex properties that go into website building.  I used partial codes created by myself during previous courses and class sessions this quarter as well as learning some helpful tips from w3schools, codepen, youtube videos, and thankfully Google.</p>
